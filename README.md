GLviewer

This is a simple python 3.7.2 script with a simple gui to show Gutter Lines in Ragnarok online. It loads the map you want to visualize and show the map with the gutter lines. It comes with a checkbox to activate windows transparecy, this was made so that it is possible to overlap the python gui with the game.
